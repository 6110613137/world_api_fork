# Task 2

## Assign Roles

### Prepare a local repository

1. Edit the **`AUTHORS`** file.

   Decide among your team members, a role each member will take. There are 2 roles, a **maintainer** and a **collaborator**.

   For this assignment

   - one team member will be a **maintainer**
   - other team members will be **collaborator A**, **collaborator B** etc.

   Append a role to each team member, for example:

   ```text
   Team X
   ======
   Name1 Surname1 <xxxxxxxxxx@cn330> Maintainer A
   Name2 Surname2 <xxxxxxxxxx@cn330> Collaborator A
   Name3 Surname3 <xxxxxxxxxx@cn330> Maintainer B
   Name4 Surname4 <xxxxxxxxxx@cn330> Collaborator B
   ```

   Maintainer A paired with Collaborator A
   Maintainer B paired with Collaborator B

2. Add and commit **`AUTHORS`** to repo.

   **RUN:**

   ```bash
   git add AUTHORS
   git commit -m "Complete Task 2"
   ```

### Check Point: Task 2

In repository **`/d/working/A06`**, there should be:

- **1 new commit**
- current total commits: **2**
